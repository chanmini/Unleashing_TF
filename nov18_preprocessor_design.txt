6.1.2. The Module Search Path

When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:

    -The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
    -PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).
    -The installation-dependent default.
