tried dataprocessing

1. found that recovered aud is not perfect in its nature. sounds bad (no matter literally or not).
2. wav_spectrogram 
    - np.ndarray
    - float32(??)
    - grayscale image with strange range of numbers
3. tried open it with imageio lib
    - converts contents with uint8 which worsen the quality of the info
    - and it flips the image somehow
4. tried open it with cv2
    - cv2.imwrite(\"path/name\",np.ndarray) : np.ndarray contents need to be float# [0,1)
    - so just putting wav_spectrogram into cv2.imwrite() will result all 0 array, just black img.
5. not straight forward but...
    howbout using wav_spectrogram ndarray as an input for our model? 

    it wouldnt hurt our result and
    might be easier to visualize the result.
