1. manually installing another version of python kernel on jupyter

for conda 
    $python -m ipykernel install --user

2. list jupyter kernels recognized by itself
    $activate env
    $jupyter-kernelspec list

3. check where jupyter looks up when it starts up.
    $ipython kernel install --prefix /tmp 

4. if kernel is not there, copy the dir where kernel and env installed as a whole, and paste it to there (do not move! copy!) 


advanced...(not tried. kernel shouldnt be named as a python I guess.)

5. installing custom kernel to a jupyter: (copying custom kernel specified below to the place where jupyter looks up)
    $jupyter kernelspec install /where/is/ur/custom/kernel/custompython
